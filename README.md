# INFSCI 2140 Homework 2

## How to Build

In your console, type:

```bash
./mvnw package
```

Then it will run all the tests and if all passed, you can find the output **runnable** JAR file in the `target` folder.

### Build environment

- Windows 10 x64
- OpenJDK 1.8.181
- Maven 3.5.4 (With wrapper)

## Unit Test

It is enforced and this project is test-driven, by using JUnit 5.3.

## Information on external libraries

Although there is a `pom.xml` and there seems to be a lot of dependencies, in the packed file there are only classes that are covered in this source code. Therefore that means it **DOES NOT** use any external libraries.
